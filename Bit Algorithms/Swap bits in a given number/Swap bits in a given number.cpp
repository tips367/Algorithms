/* Given a number x and two positions (from the right side) in the binary representation of x, write a function that swaps n bits 
at given two positions and returns the result. It is also given that the two sets of bits do not overlap.

Example 1

Input:
x = 47 (00101111)
p1 = 1 (Start from the second bit from the right side)
p2 = 5 (Start from the 6th bit from the right side)
n = 3 (No of bits to be swapped)
Output:
227 (11100011)
The 3 bits starting from the second bit (from the right side) are
swapped with 3 bits starting from 6th position (from the right side)

Example 2

Input:
x = 28 (11100)
p1 = 0 (Start from first bit from right side)
p2 = 3 (Start from 4th bit from right side)
n = 2 (No of bits to be swapped)
Output:
7 (00111)
