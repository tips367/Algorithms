<ul>
<li>The repository provides implementations of various algorithms in C++.</li>
<li>Well documented source code</li>
<li>Source codes are compiled and tested</li>
<li>Multiple approaches to solve each problem, from brute force to most optimized solutions.
</ul>

<h2>How to use this repository</h2>

1. Open the solution file (.sln) of the topic you want to explore using Visual Studio.
2. Right click on the project of choice and click "Set as StartUp Project"
3. Now run the project using F5.

Note: If you find any bug in the code or have any doubts regarding the code feel free to raise an issue or a PR.
